Welcome. I'm obsessed with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_addiction">computers</a>.

<p>I have a scatterbrained interest in a range of things.
Movies, TV shows, books, travel, bodybuilding, cycling, food,
crowdsourcing, artiificial intelligence, personal development
and getting rich quick.

<p>I like to program everything I do in Haskell. This website is generated
from <a href="">code</a>.

<p>I like to collect <a href="">datasets</a> on my hard disk
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_hoarding">(digital hoarding)</a>.

<p>I spent most of my time in front of <a href="">my computer</a>.

<p>I regularly visit a set of <a href="">bookmarks</a>.

<p>One day, I hope to save enough money to retire to a desert island
and live with a view like the above picture.

<h1>Umar's Computer</h1>
In the OS distro wars I've sided with debian (15 years desktop)
and ubuntu (5 years laptop).

<p>In the browser wars over the years I sided with
netscape, links, emacs-w3m, firefox, conkeror, chrome, and xxxterm. 

<p>In the all-important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">
editor wars</a> I've always sided with Emacs (15 years).

<p>I first learned to program with python, but have since kicked dynamic
typing to the curb and embraced the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Haskell_Compiler">
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System
</a>.

<h1>Umar's Hard Disk</h1>My hard disks are full of stuff that I mean to take a look at, but haven't yet. Years ago, it was mostly ebooks, music, and movies. I've since purged all such illegal time-sucking activity (yay for netflix), but have instead graduated my hoarding habits to data. I've divided this into two directories, kaggle datasets, and datasets that are not from kaggle.<h2>Kaggle Data</h2><img id="" src="kaggle.png" height="200"></img><ul><li><h3>CIFAR 10</h3>

<h1>Getting Rich In America : A Fact Based Guide To Becoming Wealthy</h1>

If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it?
<p>It's an age old question, and the web is full of dubious answers. We will
explore a data based model, using statistics compiled by the U.S. Census.
<p>We will use the Statistics of U.S. Business, S.U.S.B.,
whose homepage is <a href="http://www.census.gov/econ/susb/">here</a>.

<p>We focus on national data, not state data. We have 19263 rows of data to explore.

<p>We can see which are the biggest 20 industries by market size (in terms of
salaries payed).

<h2>Is Writing Down Goals Important?</h2>
<img id="" src="life_goals.jpg" height="200"></img>
<p>
https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/3getmv/question_why_should_i_write_my_goals_down_is/

<hr>Planning is an executive function that
requires you to form complex ideas. Your attention
span limits your ability to do this in your head
-- you need written language to conceptualize
complicated, nuanced ideas. Planning in writing
also allows you to quickly recall your plans and
store them unaltered in a way your brain just
cannot do.

<hr>so in practice, we should write our goal
everyday?

<p>Some people have certainly gotten a lot out of
that (but like everything, there is no 'best
answer', just what you find works).  Generally
writing out difficult thoughts helps a lot with
processing them. Helps concretize your thoughts
and extend your memory onto paper.

<hr>I write my goals down on flashcards and review them
morning and night. Helps to keep me focused on the end goal,
it's too easy to get caught up in the minutiae of day to day living.

<hr>Yep. I use a white board to write short and
long term goals.  I written out others in notes on
my phone, took a screenshot and made it my
password window. It keeps me focused and helps
greatly since I tend to lose focus quite quickly
if it is not written down.

<hr>I suffer from a certain amount of executive
dysfunction, particularly in the area of working
memory, so that would go some way to explaining
why I find planning so bloody difficult.

<p>Might be linked to motor memory and the
processing of information.

<p>Handwriting something associates it to a neural
pathway in your brain, hardwiring it. Also the
time it takes to write something down causes you
to mentally linger over it rather than having the
fleeting thought run through your mind.

<p>SMART goal setting is a very specific system
that might help you. olympic.org is a good start.

<hr>I think it helps because it is really easy to
deceive yourself and justify getting lazy or doing
something irrelevant, so if you have it written
down it works as a structure plus a static
reminder about what you need to accomplish: for eg
I have realized that even if I am disciplined I
change my goals for a day a lot leading to time
lost on decisions and such.

<hr>For me at least it helps get the thoughts in
order... Inside your head sometimes there's just
too much going in and out on a daily basis that
you can get distracted or maybe lose your track of
thoughts. That's for me. And I feel that it helps,
now if there's any scientific evidence, I don't
know

<hr>There is some scientific evidence to back it
up.

<p>From Forbes: 'There was a fascinating study
conducted on the 1979 Harvard MBA program where
graduate students were asked 'have you set clear,
written goals for your future and made plans to
accomplish them?' The result, only 3% had written
goals and plans, 13% had goals but they weren’t in
writing and 84% had no goals at all. Ten years
later, the same group was interviewed again and
the result was absolutely mind-blowing.

<p>The 13% of the class who had goals, but did not
write them down was earning twice the amount of
the 84% who had no goals.  The 3% who had written
goals were earning, on average, ten times as much
as the other 97% of the class combined!'
http://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2014/04/08/why-you-should-be-writing-down-your-goals/

<p>Apparently that study never happened and it's a
myth.  There was a similar, real study done by
Dominican University:
https://rapidbi.com/harvard-yale-written-goals-study-fact-or-fiction/#.VciTxBNViko

<hr>Im the type to think of all of my plans for the next day, but
forget the smaller details of my plan. When you write a list it
becomes an accountability. The list is there as proof of commitment.

<p>The feeling when you confidently cross out
something on the list (especially when you do so
proactively) is extremely rewarding. Likewise, the
feeling of going to sleep seeing uncrossed goals
on your list is a feeling you will hate, and
should drive you to avoid that emptiness the next
day

<hr>It seems to me that writing down your goals is
more or less a long term 'to do' list. And I have
read studies showing that those are effective.

<hr>I've done some research on self-regulation
behaviour change techniques for my PhD. I haven't
yet read any papers on the effectiveness of
writing down goals, but as other posters have
said, having an action plan for achieving your
goal is something that seems helpful.

<p>When it comes to action plans, one of the most
effective kind is called an implementation
intention. This page has a good layman's
explanation of what an implementation intention is
(as well as links to studies that have evaluated
it).  Essentially an implementation intention is
an If/Then plan for the behaviour you're looking
to change. For example, people looking to reduce
their consumption of alcohol might decide: : IF
I’ve had two drinks and I’m offered another, THEN
I’ll say “Thank you, I’ll just have an orange
juice”.

<p>Action plans seem to work because having a
concrete plan for when in a specific situation
means the plan can be performed automatically and
without conscious effort. As a result you don’t
have to rely on willpower, something which can
fluctuate and which, therefore, can't always be
relied upon.

<hr>had to watch this in first year psych and do a
goal setting worksheet

<p>if you look up 'implementation intentions'
there's a few studies where they've shown setting
detailed goals leads to higher rates of follow
through for example the difference between saying
'i'm going to check my breasts every month for
lumps' and writing down 'on the first tuesday of
every month at 8am before i shower i will check my
breasts for lumps' - the people who do the latter
are much more likely to actually do what they've
said

<hr>It's like setting a date for a follow up
doctor's appointment, rather than saying 'I'll see
you in three months'.

<hr>Consider the implementation of habits as a
means to achieve your goals. There is a lot of
research on how to form habits, with a good source
being the book called The Power of Habit, as it
covers with lot of the research. Habits are very
well understood as conditioning

<p>I like the idea of goals, but I don't think
they work well on their own. A lot of older self
help material focuses on goals and action plans,
and it is too easy to just lose traction. A lot of
the newer material is still big on goals, but more
as a means of creating habits.

<p>Goals are still important as they are a
destination you want to reach. It is unlikely that
you'll end up where you want by just driving
around. But keep in mind that even if you have a
goal, you still have to drive there, and the
method you choose to ensure you act on that goal
over time is what is important.

<p>Currently I have a goal to save $5000 by
February. The habit I am cultivating involves
setting aside a specific amount of money every
paycheck. I want to make saving that money as
automatic as possible, I don't want to have to use
any will power.

<p>Writing a goal down is not needed, but most
people have terrible memories and will be really
hazy about what they need to do to achieve
it. Sure, you can do a complex math problem in
your head, but it helps a lot to write it down and
to show your work.  Worse, when it is in your
head, you'll have to solve the same problem again
and again which discourages you from thinking
about it as the mind avoids effort.

<hr>Not so much a science, but just a really great
method for task management. I recommend the book
'Getting Things Done' by David Allen. There is
plenty of software out there that uses his
method. I use Omnifocus and it is absolutely game
changing for my productivity.

<hr>The Writing Assignment That Changes Lives

<p>http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/10/419202925/the-writing-assignment-that-changes-lives

<hr>I think the writing of goals is probably more
of a memory thing. If I've only thought the goal,
then I have to actively remember it. If I write it
down, however, I can be reminded of it instead,
which frees up headspace for pursuing the goal.

<hr>Look at what the invention of writing did for
humanity. Imagine what it can do for you.

<hr>The Writing Assignment That Changes Lives

<p>July 10, 2015 8:03 AM ET <br>Anya Kamenetz

<p>Why do you do what you do? What is the engine
that keeps you up late at night or gets you going
in the morning? Where is your happy place? What
stands between you and your ultimate dream?

<p>Heavy questions. One researcher believes that
writing down the answers can be decisive for
students.

<p>He co-authored a paper that demonstrates a
startling effect: nearly erasing the gender and
ethnic minority achievement gap for 700 students
over the course of two years with a short written
exercise in setting goals.

<p>Jordan Peterson teaches in the department of
psychology at the University of Toronto. For
decades, he has been fascinated by the effects of
writing on organizing thoughts and emotions.

<p>Experiments going back to the 1980s have shown
that 'therapeutic' or 'expressive' writing can
reduce depression, increase productivity and even
cut down on visits to the doctor.

<p>'The act of writing is more powerful than
people think,' Peterson says.

<p>Most people grapple at some time or another
with free-floating anxiety that saps energy and
increases stress. Through written reflection, you
may realize that a certain unpleasant feeling ties
back to, say, a difficult interaction with your
mother. That type of insight, research has shown,
can help locate, ground and ultimately resolve the
emotion and the associated stress.

<p>At the same time, 'goal-setting theory' holds
that writing down concrete, specific goals and
strategies can help people overcome obstacles and
achieve.

<p>'It Turned My Life Around'

<p>Recently, researchers have been getting more
and more interested in the role that mental
motivation plays in academic achievement —
sometimes conceptualized as 'grit' or 'growth
mindset' or 'executive functioning.'

<p>Peterson wondered whether writing could be
shown to affect student motivation. He created an
undergraduate course called Maps of Meaning. In
it, students complete a set of writing exercises
that combine expressive writing with goal-setting.

<p>Students reflect on important moments in their
past, identify key personal motivations and create
plans for the future, including specific goals and
strategies to overcome obstacles. Peterson calls
the two parts 'past authoring' and 'future
authoring.'

<p>'It completely turned my life around,' says
Christine Brophy, who, as an undergraduate several
years ago, was battling drug abuse and health
problems and was on the verge of dropping
out. After taking Peterson's course at the
University of Toronto, she changed her
major. Today she is a doctoral student and one of
Peterson's main research assistants.

<p>In an early study at McGill University in
Montreal, the course showed a powerful positive
effect with at-risk students, reducing the dropout
rate and increasing academic achievement.

<p>Peterson is seeking a larger audience for what
he has dubbed 'self-authoring.' He started a
for-profit company and is selling a version of the
curriculum online. Brophy and Peterson have found
a receptive audience in the Netherlands.

<p>At the Rotterdam School of Management, a
shortened version of self-authoring has been
mandatory for all first-year students since
2011. (These are undergraduates — they choose
majors early in Europe).

<p>The latest paper, published in June, compares
the performance of the first complete class of
freshmen to use self-authoring with that of the
three previous classes.

<p>Overall, the 'self-authoring' students greatly
improved the number of credits earned and their
likelihood of staying in school. And after two
years, ethnic and gender-group differences in
performance among the students had all but
disappeared.

<p>The ethnic minorities in question made up about
one-fifth of the students. They are first- and
second-generation immigrants from non-Western
backgrounds — Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

<p>While the history and legacy of racial
oppression are different from that in the United
States, the Netherlands still struggles with large
differences in wealth and educational attainment
among majority and minority groups.

<p>'Zeroes Are Deadly'

<p>At the Rotterdam school, minorities generally
underperformed the majority by more than a third,
earning on average eight fewer credits their first
year and four fewer credits their second year. But
for minority students who had done this set of
writing exercises, that gap dropped to five
credits the first year and to just one-fourth of
one credit in the second year.

<p>How could a bunch of essays possibly have this
effect on academic performance? Is this
replicable?

<p>Melinda Karp is the assistant director for
staff and institutional development at the
Community College Research Center at Teachers
College, Columbia University. She leads studies on
interventions that can improve college
completion. She calls Peterson's paper
'intriguing.' But, she adds, 'I don't believe
there are silver bullets for any of this in higher
ed.'

<p>Peterson believes that formal goal-setting can
especially help minority students overcome what's
often called 'stereotype threat,' or, in other
words, to reject the damaging belief that
generalizations about ethnic-group academic
performance will apply to them personally.

<p>Karp agrees. 'When you enter a new social role,
such as entering college as a student, the
expectations aren't always clear.' There's a
greater risk for students who may be academically
underprepared or who lack role models. 'Students
need help not just setting vague goals but
figuring out a plan to reach them.'

<p>The key for this intervention came at crunch
time, says Peterson. 'We increased the probability
that students would actually take their exams and
hand in their assignments.' The act of
goal-setting helped them overcome obstacles when
the stakes were highest. 'You don't have to be a
genius to get through school, you don't even have
to be that interested. But zeroes are deadly.'

<p>Karp has a theory for how this might be
working. She says you often see at-risk students
engage in self-defeating behavior 'to save face.'

<p>'If you aren't sure you belong in college, and
you don't hand in that paper,' she explains, 'you
can say to yourself, 'That's because I didn't do
the work, not because I don't belong here.' '

<p>Writing down their internal motivations and
connecting daily efforts to blue-sky goals may
have helped these young people solidify their
identities as students.

<p>Brophy is testing versions of the
self-authoring curriculum at two high schools in
Rotterdam, and monitoring their psychological
well-being, school attendance and tendency to
procrastinate.

<p>Early results are promising, she says: 'It
helps students understand what they really want to
do.'</p>
