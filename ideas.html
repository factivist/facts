<hr>Planning is an executive function that requires you to form complex ideas. Your
attention span limits your ability to do this in your head -- you need written
language to conceptualize complicated, nuanced ideas. Planning in writing also
allows you to quickly recall your plans and store them unaltered in a way your
brain just cannot do.

<hr>so in practice, we should write our goal everyday?

<p>Some people have certainly gotten a lot out of that (but like everything, there
is no 'best answer', just what you find works). Generally writing out difficult
thoughts helps a lot with processing them. Helps concretize your thoughts and
extend your memory onto paper.

<hr>I write my goals down on flashcards and review them morning and night. Helps to
keep me focused on the end goal, it's too easy to get caught up in the minutiae
of day to day living.

<hr>Yep. I use a white board to write short and long term goals. I written out
others in notes on my phone, took a screenshot and made it my password window.
It keeps me focused and helps greatly since I tend to lose focus quite quickly
if it is not written down.

<hr>I suffer from a certain amount of executive dysfunction, particularly in the
area of working memory, so that would go some way to explaining why I find
planning so bloody difficult.

<p>Might be linked to motor memory and the processing of information.
<p>Handwriting something associates it to a neural pathway in your brain,
hardwiring it. Also the time it takes to write something down causes you to
mentally linger over it rather than having the fleeting thought run through your
mind.
<p>SMART goal setting is a very specific system that might help you. olympic.org is
a good start.

<hr>I think it helps because it is really easy to deceive yourself and justify
getting lazy or doing something irrelevant, so if you have it written down it
works as a structure plus a static reminder about what you need to accomplish:
for eg I have realized that even if I am disciplined I change my goals for a day
a lot leading to time lost on decisions and such.

<hr>For me at least it helps get the thoughts in order... Inside your head sometimes
there's just too much going in and out on a daily basis that you can get
distracted or maybe lose your track of thoughts. That's for me. And I feel that
it helps, now if there's any scientific evidence, I don't know

<hr>There is some scientific evidence to back it up.

<p>From Forbes: 'There was a fascinating study conducted on the 1979 Harvard MBA
program where graduate students were asked 'have you set clear, written goals
for your future and made plans to accomplish them?' The result, only 3% had
written goals and plans, 13% had goals but they weren’t in writing and 84% had
no goals at all. Ten years later, the same group was interviewed again and the
result was absolutely mind-blowing.

<p>The 13% of the class who had goals, but did not write them down was earning
twice the amount of the 84% who had no goals. The 3% who had written goals were
earning, on average, ten times as much as the other 97% of the class combined!'
http://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2014/04/08/
why-you-should-be-writing-down-your-goals/

<p>Apparently that study never happened and it's a myth. There was a similar, real
study done by Dominican University: https://rapidbi.com/
harvard-yale-written-goals-study-fact-or-fiction/#.VciTxBNViko

<hr>Im the type to think of all of my plans for the next day, but forget the smaller
details of my plan. When you write a list it becomes an accountability. The list
is there as proof of commitment.

<p>The feeling when you confidently cross out something on the list (especially
when you do so proactively) is extremely rewarding. Likewise, the feeling of
going to sleep seeing uncrossed goals on your list is a feeling you will hate,
and should drive you to avoid that emptiness the next day

<hr>It seems to me that writing down your goals is more or less a long term 'to do'
list. And I have read studies showing that those are effective.

<hr>I've done some research on self-regulation behaviour change techniques for my
PhD. I haven't yet read any papers on the effectiveness of writing down goals,
but as other posters have said, having an action plan for achieving your goal is
something that seems helpful.

<p>When it comes to action plans, one of the most effective kind is called an
implementation intention. This page has a good layman's explanation of what an
implementation intention is (as well as links to studies that have evaluated
it). Essentially an implementation intention is an If/Then plan for the
behaviour you're looking to change. For example, people looking to reduce their
consumption of alcohol might decide: : IF I’ve had two drinks and I’m offered
another, THEN I’ll say “Thank you, I’ll just have an orange juice”.

<p>Action plans seem to work because having a concrete plan for when in a specific
situation means the plan can be performed automatically and without conscious
effort. As a result you don’t have to rely on willpower, something which can
fluctuate and which, therefore, can't always be relied upon.

<hr>had to watch this in first year psych and do a goal setting worksheet

<p>if you look up 'implementation intentions' there's a few studies where they've
shown setting detailed goals leads to higher rates of follow through for example
the difference between saying 'i'm going to check my breasts every month for
lumps' and writing down 'on the first tuesday of every month at 8am before i
shower i will check my breasts for lumps' - the people who do the latter are
much more likely to actually do what they've said

<hr>It's like setting a date for a follow up doctor's appointment, rather than
saying 'I'll see you in three months'.

<hr>Consider the implementation of habits as a means to achieve your goals. There is
a lot of research on how to form habits, with a good source being the book
called The Power of Habit, as it covers with lot of the research. Habits are
very well understood as conditioning

<p>I like the idea of goals, but I don't think they work well on their own. A lot
of older self help material focuses on goals and action plans, and it is too
easy to just lose traction. A lot of the newer material is still big on goals,
but more as a means of creating habits.

<p>Goals are still important as they are a destination you want to reach. It is
unlikely that you'll end up where you want by just driving around. But keep in
mind that even if you have a goal, you still have to drive there, and the method
you choose to ensure you act on that goal over time is what is important.

<p>Currently I have a goal to save $5000 by February. The habit I am cultivating
involves setting aside a specific amount of money every paycheck. I want to make
saving that money as automatic as possible, I don't want to have to use any will
power.

<p>Writing a goal down is not needed, but most people have terrible memories and
will be really hazy about what they need to do to achieve it. Sure, you can do a
complex math problem in your head, but it helps a lot to write it down and to
show your work. Worse, when it is in your head, you'll have to solve the same
problem again and again which discourages you from thinking about it as the mind
avoids effort.

<hr>Not so much a science, but just a really great method for task management. I
recommend the book 'Getting Things Done' by David Allen. There is plenty of
software out there that uses his method. I use Omnifocus and it is absolutely
game changing for my productivity.

the-writing-assignment-that-changes-lives

<hr>I think the writing of goals is probably more of a memory thing. If I've only
thought the goal, then I have to actively remember it. If I write it down,
however, I can be reminded of it instead, which frees up headspace for pursuing
the goal.

<hr>Look at what the invention of writing did for humanity. Imagine what it can do
for you.



<hr>The Writing Assignment That Changes Lives

<p>July 10, 2015 8:03 AM ET

<p>Why do you do what you do? What is the engine that keeps you up late at night or
gets you going in the morning? Where is your happy place? What stands between
you and your ultimate dream?

<p>Heavy questions. One researcher believes that writing down the answers can be
decisive for students.

<p>He co-authored a paper that demonstrates a startling effect: nearly erasing the
gender and ethnic minority achievement gap for 700 students over the course of
two years with a short written exercise in setting goals.

<p>Jordan Peterson teaches in the department of psychology at the University of
Toronto. For decades, he has been fascinated by the effects of writing on
organizing thoughts and emotions.

<p>Experiments going back to the 1980s have shown that 'therapeutic' or
'expressive' writing can reduce depression, increase productivity and even cut
down on visits to the doctor.

<p>'The act of writing is more powerful than people think,' Peterson says.

<p>Most people grapple at some time or another with free-floating anxiety that saps
energy and increases stress. Through written reflection, you may realize that a
certain unpleasant feeling ties back to, say, a difficult interaction with your
mother. That type of insight, research has shown, can help locate, ground and
ultimately resolve the emotion and the associated stress.

<p>At the same time, 'goal-setting theory' holds that writing down concrete,
specific goals and strategies can help people overcome obstacles and achieve.

<p>'It Turned My Life Around'

<p>Recently, researchers have been getting more and more interested in the role
that mental motivation plays in academic achievement — sometimes conceptualized
as 'grit' or 'growth mindset' or 'executive functioning.'

<p>Peterson wondered whether writing could be shown to affect student motivation.
He created an undergraduate course called Maps of Meaning. In it, students
complete a set of writing exercises that combine expressive writing with
goal-setting.

<p>Students reflect on important moments in their past, identify key personal
motivations and create plans for the future, including specific goals and
strategies to overcome obstacles. Peterson calls the two parts 'past authoring'
and 'future authoring.'

<p>'It completely turned my life around,' says Christine Brophy, who, as an
undergraduate several years ago, was battling drug abuse and health problems and
was on the verge of dropping out. After taking Peterson's course at the
University of Toronto, she changed her major. Today she is a doctoral student
and one of Peterson's main research assistants.

<p>In an early study at McGill University in Montreal, the course showed a powerful
positive effect with at-risk students, reducing the dropout rate and increasing
academic achievement.

<p>Peterson is seeking a larger audience for what he has dubbed 'self-authoring.'
He started a for-profit company and is selling a version of the curriculum
online. Brophy and Peterson have found a receptive audience in the Netherlands.

<p>At the Rotterdam School of Management, a shortened version of self-authoring has
been mandatory for all first-year students since 2011. (These are undergraduates
— they choose majors early in Europe).

<p>The latest paper, published in June, compares the performance of the first
complete class of freshmen to use self-authoring with that of the three previous
classes.

<p>Overall, the 'self-authoring' students greatly improved the number of credits
earned and their likelihood of staying in school. And after two years, ethnic
and gender-group differences in performance among the students had all but
disappeared.

<p>The ethnic minorities in question made up about one-fifth of the students. They
are first- and second-generation immigrants from non-Western backgrounds —
Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

<p>While the history and legacy of racial oppression are different from that in the
United States, the Netherlands still struggles with large differences in wealth
and educational attainment among majority and minority groups.

<p>'Zeroes Are Deadly'

<p>At the Rotterdam school, minorities generally underperformed the majority by
more than a third, earning on average eight fewer credits their first year and
four fewer credits their second year. But for minority students who had done
this set of writing exercises, that gap dropped to five credits the first year
and to just one-fourth of one credit in the second year.

<p>How could a bunch of essays possibly have this effect on academic performance?
Is this replicable?

<p>Melinda Karp is the assistant director for staff and institutional development
at the Community College Research Center at Teachers College, Columbia
University. She leads studies on interventions that can improve college
completion. She calls Peterson's paper 'intriguing.' But, she adds, 'I don't
believe there are silver bullets for any of this in higher ed.'

<p>Peterson believes that formal goal-setting can especially help minority students
overcome what's often called 'stereotype threat,' or, in other words, to reject
the damaging belief that generalizations about ethnic-group academic performance
will apply to them personally.

<p>Karp agrees. 'When you enter a new social role, such as entering college as a
student, the expectations aren't always clear.' There's a greater risk for
students who may be academically underprepared or who lack role models.
'Students need help not just setting vague goals but figuring out a plan to
reach them.'

<p>The key for this intervention came at crunch time, says Peterson. 'We increased
the probability that students would actually take their exams and hand in their
assignments.' The act of goal-setting helped them overcome obstacles when the
stakes were highest. 'You don't have to be a genius to get through school; you
don't even have to be that interested. But zeroes are deadly.'

<p>Karp has a theory for how this might be working. She says you often see at-risk
students engage in self-defeating behavior 'to save face.'

<p>'If you aren't sure you belong in college, and you don't hand in that paper,'
